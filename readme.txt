The one and only next generation podcast publishing system. Seriously. It's magical and sparkles a lot.

== Description ==

We built the Podlove Podcast Publisher because existing solutions are stuck in the past, complex and unwieldy. The Publisher helps you save time, worry less and provides a cutting edge listening experience for your audience.

Official Site: [publisher.podlove.org](http://publisher.podlove.org/)

= Video Tutorial: Getting started with Podlove Publisher =

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmrm-jUe6u4]

= Compatible Feeds =

The Publisher makes it easy to create highly expressive, efficient and super compatible podcast feeds with fine grained control over client behavior (e.g. GUID control to replace faulty episodes and for clients to reload) supporting all important meta data.

= Multi-Format Publishing =

The Publisher also makes multi-format publishing - embracing all modern and legacy audio and video codecs - a snap. By adopting simple file name conventions, the plugin allows the podcaster to provide individual feeds for certain use cases or audiences without adding work for the podcaster during the publishing process.

= Optimized Web Player =

The Publisher also comes with integrated with the Podlove Web Player plugin (which you do not need to install separately) and fully support its advanced options including multiple audio (MP4 AAC, MP3, Vorbis, Opus) and video (MP4 H.264, WebM, Theora) format support for web browsers. This Web Player is fully HTML5 compatible (but provides Flash fallback for ancient environments) and is ready for all touch based clients too.

= Chapter Support =

The Publisher also makes it easy to publish chapter information in the player to make access to structured episodes even easier. Full support for linking directly to any part of your podcast on the web with instant playback included.

= Flexible Templates =

To round it all up, a flexible template system enables you to published Podcasts in a defined fashion and change the style at any time without having to touch your individual postings later on.

And this is just the beginning. We have a rich roadmap that will bring even more interesting features: integration with helpful services, much improved timeline metadata support (show notes) and much more.

**Preparation for GDPR/DSGVO**

If you are using Podlove Publisher Tracking/Analytics, an update to this version is highly recommended.

Tracking uses a `request_id` to be able to determine when two requests came from the same user and should be counted as one unique access. This request id used to be a hash of the original IP address and the user agent. This approach however is vulnerable to a brute force attack to get the IP address back from the hash. Here's what we are doing about that:

First, we anonymize the IP before generating the hash. So instead of using `171.23.11.209`, we use `171.23.11.0`.

Second, you need to deal with the existing `request_id`s. There is a new "DSGVO" section under "Tools" with a button that will rehash all existing `request_id`s with a randomly generated salt. That way it will become unfeasible to determine the original IP address but your analytics will stay the same.

In case you have a lot of downloads (let's say much more than 50.000), you may want to do this via command line because that will be _much_ quicker than via the tools section. You need [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/), then simply call `wp eval 'podlove_rehash_tracking_request_ids();'`. On a multisite, pass the blog id as a parameter: `wp eval 'podlove_rehash_tracking_request_ids(42);'`.

**Other**

* fix Podlove Subscribe Button language parameter
* fix `rel="self"` link in show feeds
* fix Podlove Subscribe Button not delivering show feeds
* templates: handle episode.show access when there is no show
* templates: allow episode filtering by show, for example: `{% for episode in podcast.episodes({show: "example"}) %}`

_2.7.4_

No changes, but the previous release is not delivered correctly by WordPress, so this is simply a re-release attempt to fix it.

= 2018-04-15 =

* allow file access even when it's not marked as "downloadable"

= 2018-04-04 =

* update webvtt parser

Add changes from 2.7 branch:

_2.7.3_

* fix: geo database updater
* update Podlove Web Player 2: remove Flash Fallback
* update Podlove Web Player 4

_2.7.2_

* fix: `itunes:image` tag in show feeds
* fix: "Debug Tracking" choosing wrong media files to check availability
* enhancement: "Debug Tracking" now suggests disabling SSL-peer-verification if URL cannot be resolved and https is used
* system report: include active plugins

_2.7.1_

* fix: PHP warning when the_title filter is called with only one parameter
* fix: handle colons in migration tool
* fix: PWP4 warning when using shortcode
* new service: letterboxd

= 2018-03-25 =

- when a tracking request does not work because the asset is configured as not downloadable, respond with 403 instead of 404

= 2018-03-24 =

Transcripts can now be rendered using the Template API. Here's an example template to get started:

    <style>
    .ts-line { margin-bottom: 5px; }
    .ts-line .time { font-family: monospace; }
    </style>
    
    {% for line in episode.transcript %}
     <div class="ts-line">
         <small>
         <span class="time">{{ line.start }}&ndash;{{ line.end }}</span>
         {% if line.contributor %}
           <strong>{{ line.contributor.name }}</strong>
         {% endif %}
         </small>
         <div>{{ line.content }}</div>
     </div>
    {% endfor %}

= 2018-03-23 =

- fix: no transcripts tab in player when there are no transcripts

= 2.8.0 prototype =

2.8.0 adds the "Transcripts" module. If you are using Podlove Web Player 4 and are have transcripts (or are willing to create them), give it a go. Currently webvtt is the only supported transcript format.

Once you enable the module, you can import transcripts in the episode screen below the chapter marks UI. You should also have the "Contributors" module enabled so you can assign "voices" in the transcript.
